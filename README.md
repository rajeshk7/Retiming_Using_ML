# Retiming_Using_ML

Register manipulation algorithms which are in use today are heuristic based and they donâ€™t provide the global optimum always. 
So in order to achieve something we may have to try different ways to get things done.
And if the circuit is large enough then finding thing and fine tuning all these by hand is not near to possible.

Background : 

Machine learning has been widely used in nearly all aspects in modern time
Starting form drug design to friendship recommendation it has given tremendous results in all fields
The domain of CAD for VLSI is no different, and has also potential to adapt the power of machine learning to generate fruitful results.
Here we aim to generate a unsupervised model for the task

Aim : 

We aim to develop a model that can enable register motion and provide the optimum timing results every time
We aim to test some potential models and compare the results to get the best model suitable for the task
